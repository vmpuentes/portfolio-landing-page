        <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Born in San Francisco, CA, raised in Seattle, WA, educated in Boston, MA (Berklee '07), refined in Philadelphia, and now back in the musical richness of the PNW, I have always played my horn in musicallyÂ­ fertile cities. Starting at the age of 6 on the clarinet and then to trumpet at nine, I've always knew music would be a lifelong journey for me, so I worked on honing my skills and have tried diligently to keep practicing. I would say my hard work at an early age is what earned me a scholarship to Berklee College of Music. Going to school for music changed my concept of music forever! While in school, I immersed myself into the Boston Music scene and studied with some amazing professors that always challenged me musically.Through the years I has also made an effort to study independently and hounded some of my favorite artists to give me music lessons, I had and have no shame in asking people to teach me something. I believe this attitude led me to performance opportunities with world-reknowns artists like <em>Gloria Estefan</em> and the <em>Chieftains</em>.</p>

         <h2>Hobbies</h2>
           <ul>
             <li>I <span class="love">love</span> to cook. I've had some great cooking teachers and experiences in my life that I'm grateful for. I used to be a line cook at Benaroyal Hall for Wolfgang puck Catering, it was a great experience that taught many cooking techniques that I never knew, but nothing can compare to watching and learning from my grandmothers in the kitchen.</li>
             <li>I <span class="love">love</span> to exercise...although I don't do it as often as I should.</li>
             <li>I <span class="love">love</span> to play poker, especially with family and friends.</li>
             <li>I <span class="love">love</span> to travel, I've only been to three continents and would love to tackle the rest in my lifetime. Yes, even Antartica!</li>
             <li>I <span class="love">love</span> to hear live music. There's nothing like it.</li>
             <li>I <span class="love">love</span> to learn. I try very hard to always keep an open-mind and have humility in what I know and what I think I know in order to keep learning.</li>            </ul>
